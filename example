{\ul;\bf[John 21:20-22]}

20	Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following;
	which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, "Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?"
21	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, "Lord, and what {\it[shall]} this man {\it[do]}?
22	Jesus saith unto him, "{\red[If I will that he tarry till I come, what]} {\it;\red[is that]} {\red[to thee? follow thou me]}."


{\ul[Or, for a simpler bit of syntax]}:
22	Jesus saith unto him, "{\red[If I will that he tarry till I come, what {\it[is that]} {\red[to thee? follow thou me]}."
