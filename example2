			{\bu[Thomas and Herbert and the Tale of the Magical Shoe]}

Once upon a time, there lived an old man named Herbert who owned a shoe...

	Now, this was not an {\it[ordinary]} shoe, as some may surmise, but in fact was a {\ult[magical]} shoe!
Now, Thomas was an inquisitive child and his grandfather loved him dearly,
but old man Herbert was nervous about introducing dear Thomas to the shoe.
So naturally, he was sweating like bullets when the boy asked, "{\it[Grandpa, why is there a shoe in a glass case]}?"

	With a gulp, old man Hebert said, "{\it[Well, see, son, that there's a special shoe]}... "

	"{\it[Why--it looks like an ordinary shoe to me?]}"

	"{\it[See, it's a magical shoe]}... "

	Perplexed, the boy's brows and face were-a-furrow and he cocked his head to the side.
Thousands of thoughts flew through his head, but not-a-one-of-them had a single-incling of belief around it.
The old man grew rather nervous as the awkward silence overtook them both.

	"{\it[Where'd it come from]}," the boy shot out.

	"{\bif[Vegas]}."

	The boys eyes grew and face blanked...

Later that night, the boy stood in a chair, attempting to reach the glass box over the mantle.
His fingers barely reached it and it slid off, crashing loudly on the ground, slivers of glass flying everywhere.
Thomas frose in fear and saw a metal plate affixed to the bottom of the shoe with letters stamped in;
scared, he ran to his room and hid beneath the covers as he heard his grandfather's stirred voice and a fiddle at the knob of his door.
The whole world, though, was silent as he pondered the meaning of the words...

	"{\ul[In memory of the woman I loved]}... "
